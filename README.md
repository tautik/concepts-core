# Core Concepts Implementation

A hands-on exploration of fundamental backend and system design concepts through practical implementations.

## Projects Overview

1. **[Multi-Threading & Fair Work Distribution](01-multi-thread/)**
   - Sequential vs multi-threaded processing
   - Fair thread allocation and load balancing
   - Race condition prevention using locks
   - Prime number counting performance comparison

2. **[Database Connection Pooling using Bounded Blocking Queue](02-connection-pooling/)**
   - Connection pool implementation with thread-safe queues
   - Performance benchmarking: pooled vs non-pooled connections
   - Resource management and hardware limitation handling

## Learning Objectives

- **Concurrency & Threading**: Understanding multi-threaded programming, synchronization, and resource sharing
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, sharding, replication, and performance tuning
- **Real-time Communication**: Event-driven architectures, WebSockets, and message brokers
- **System Design**: Scalability patterns, load distribution, and fault tolerance
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS services integration and deployment strategies

## Getting Started

Each project contains:
- **README.md**: Detailed explanation of concepts and implementation

- **Databases**: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Message Brokers**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Cloud**: AWS EC2
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO, Server-Sent Events
